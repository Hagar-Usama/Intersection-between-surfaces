## Introduction
Surfaces? Why would we ever need to get Intersection between 'Surfaces'?

> Think of *OpenSCAD*, *SolidWorks*, or *Blinder*. Can any of them work without the base knowledge of 'intersection of surfaces'? Most probably no.
Great things are built step by step! 💪

The project was initiated in 2017, with two students : **Mariam Mourad** & [me][22]. Unfortunately, I got to know **version control** services a year later.

## Technologies

The project is implemented in MATLAB, and:
* provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* uses the very basic geometrical concepts

---

## Launch

 How to Launch?
> Unluckily, you have to get MATLAB installed on your machine!

* Open the m file 'intersection.m', add it to the path, and run it


 Can I use Octave?
 > As a Linux-biased one, I usually use Octave in my work. *(MATLAB is now available on Linux BTW)*. But when it comes to GUI, I think this won't work.
